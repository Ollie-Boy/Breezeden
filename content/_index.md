Gorgeous, delightful, fantastic, elegant, handsome, ~~cute~~ me.

Pronouns: He/Him ~~(Attack Helicopter)~~.

Welcome to my brain dump — it's a bit of a mess here, honestly. Expect some incoherence, inconsistency, a LOT of edits, lazy grammar, punctuation mistakes, and a few **"what was I thinking?"** moments. Basically, everything you read here is a *work in progress*.

## A Little Bit About Me

My journey with computers started back in primary school. I was instantly hooked! But, for reasons I've long forgotten, I put it aside. To my shame, the real adventure began only last year. I still vividly remember when I met my friend **Bowa** at school, and we spent countless hours playing Minecraft together on a modded server. He introduced me to coding in Minecraft using Lua, and I was mind-blown — how could you code *inside* a game?! Suddenly, my childhood dream of being a ~~hacker~~ (you know, the cool, mysterious kind) resurfaced. I started asking **Aunt Google** (aka the all-knowing oracle) how to begin.

## The Coding Rollercoaster

Let’s take a ride through my learning experience.

1. **Python** — Ah, the good old beginner’s choice. I did also read some articles. But, well... I quickly abandoned it. #SorryPython

2. **C++** — My brief flirty phase with Embedded Development. I dabbled a bit, but didn’t dive deep. Decided it wasn’t quite "the one" for me. 

3. **Java** — *The Chosen One.* Java became my main goal, the platform for all things mobile, web apps, enterprise software, IoT, gaming, big data... basically everything under the sun. I even tried building my own blog with the Java knowledge I learned. And yes, I’m still learning it (just... slowly).

4. **Go** — And of course, there’s a fourth. **Go**! Why? Because I want to create my own Hugo theme. There are *tons* of amazing themes out there, but none of them have the wild ideas swirling around in my head (lol).

## My Hero: Koshiro (Izzy) from Digimon Adventure

Oh, and by the way, I *love* Koshiro (Izzy) from Digimon Adventure. I'm a huge fan of him! His intelligence, his love for technology, and his ability to think on his feet in tough situations really resonate with me. I guess that's part of why I gravitated towards coding — I always admired characters like him who could "make things work" with a little creativity and knowledge. And yeah, he's a legend in my book!
